# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation behind this webpage was to learn about using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this project to become more familiar with coding, debugging, and using GitHub. This webpage solves the problem of where to store all of the information that I have learned during prework. I learned throughout this process some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding basics. I also learned how VS Code and GitHub interact. Finally, I learned the importance of debugging.
