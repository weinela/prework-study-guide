        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML is the frame of the webpage (house analogy).</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attribue- defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>Parent elemtns are elements that hold all the other elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements- the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. They make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>Tag refers only to what appears inside the angled brackets.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS- used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet- contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet- most common because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside and element.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks which branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript adds interactivity to our website.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is the house once we can interact with it.</li>
        <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)- built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles.</li>
        <li>Third-Party APIs- allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter and Facebook.</li>
        <li>Variables- containers that store values; use "let" keyword followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
        <li>JavaScript is case sensitive!</li>
        <li>Control Flow- the order in which a computer executes code. In JS it runs from top to bottom.</li>
        <li>Conditional Statements- allow us to alter the control flow so that code executes only if a certain condition is met.</li>
        <li>Array- a group of related data. A single variable that is used to hold a group of ideas or related data.</li>
        <li>Index- unique number where the location of the data item in the array is identified.</li>
        <li>for loops- use the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Function- a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. They are different from loops because they don't automatically execute when the JS file is run!</li>
        <li>Requirements of a function: define the function, code block, call the function. </li>
      </ul>
