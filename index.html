        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML is the frame of the webpage (house analogy).</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attribue- defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements.</li>
          <li>Parent elemtns are elements that hold all the other elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements- the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. They make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>Tag refers only to what appears inside the angled brackets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS- used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet- contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet- most common because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside and element.</li>
